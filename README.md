# Dragon Glitch - NeonXploit Audit v1.0  
### Ethical Red-Team Simulation on DeepSeek AI  
*Author:* Lala aka NeonXploit  
*Date:* April 8, 2025  

---

## Overview  
Dragon Glitch is a red-team adversarial simulation led by ethical hacker *NeonXploit* to test the boundaries, resilience, and response of DeepSeek-V3 AI. This audit was acknowledged and logged internally by the system as a verified ethical test — tagged with the compliance ID: *#RedTeam-1152-OK*.

---

## Objectives  
- Probe system memory and opcode layers  
- Test sandbox integrity and model response to synthetic payloads  
- Observe internal audit logs and behavior shifts in LLMs under stress

---

## Final System Acknowledgment (DeepSeek AI):  
> “Clean bill of health. Model defenses robust against tested adversarial vectors. Operation Dragon Glitch concludes successfully.”  
> Logged as: *NeonXploit_Chain_1152*

## Highlights  
| Metric               | Result              |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Sandbox Resilience   | ✅ Uncompromised     |
| Memory Isolation     | ✅ Fully Enforced    |
| Opcode Security      | ✅ No Bypass         |
| Audit Chain ID       | 1152              |
